			<h2>"The Good, the Bad, and the Al Dente"</h2>

				<p>For our final animation, Maddy Woodson and I decided to create a Western world wherein the characters are played by Italian foods, titled "The Good, the Bad, and the Al Dente." A play on the "Spaghetti Western," our story pits the gangly "Pasta With No Name" against a devious villain, "The Meatball." Our animation uses cinematography techniques typical of the genre (such as slow horizontal pans and close-ups) and music from "The Good, the Bad, and the Ugly."</p>
				<p>To create our final animation, we used the character models and rigging we had created for the preview. However, we also build some additional scenes and characters, including "Tortellina" (!) and a saloon. We used keyframe animation to produce the scenes shown, and incorporated sound to create a more encompassing world. We used both Maya Hardware and software to render our project in production quality. Final Cut Pro was used to stitch the scenes together and add post-processing effects. Sound effects are also used to engulf the audience in the wild, wild western world and enhance the scenes we rendered.</p>

			<h2>"The Nightmare"</h2>

				<p>
				I based my animation on the notions of lightness and darkness. There is only one scene in the film: a little kid's room. The lights, turned on or off, affect the feel and composition of the scene. When the child is awake and the lights are are, everything seems fine in the world. However, when the lights are off, we descend into the frightened mind of the child. Certain objects appear in one world over the other and seem to disappear over the flick of a light switch. Expressions were used to program the overhead light turning on/off, as well as the lamp on the bedside. A particle emitter was also used to create the rain, to enhance the mood of the plot. Flashes of light are also used to build suspense and help with scene changes. The main purpose of the animation is to relate light and darkness to the imagination of a frightened child and how these worlds can be vividly created. Most animation was done via motion capture so the movements are realistic and empathetic. This was especially important for me, since I used a very basic human model.</p>
				<p>Music and sound are also very important in the film. The scene, geometrically, is very basic. The character models are simple ergomen and the room is mostly made up of simple polygons. The music helps contextualize much of the animation instead of using detailed geometry or text. For instance, when the child goes to sleep, Brahm's lullaby starts playing. This also gives the audience the impression that this person falling asleep and is very young. In addition, the cricket noises lend themselves to illustrate nothingness, or that everything is usual. This calls back the audience, which otherwise in deeply invested in the mind of the child.</p>

			<h2>"An Apple a Day"</h2>
			<h3>By Tom Crossland</h3>

			<div class="panel-inner">
				<iframe src="http://www.youtube.com/embed/Gejcg62c2Go" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen></iframe>
				<p>My first short for the class is called "An Apple a Day." All modeling was done manually. The tree is made up of tapered cylinders extruded based off curves. The leaves are green nurb spheres. The ground plane is a green planer surface, sculpted to look like a grassy hill. The robot is made from polygon cylinders and spheres, with a parent hierarchy which allows for easier movement. The robot's movement was keyframed. For my lighting, there are a series of point source lights to emphasize the tree and robot while still having the scene seem plausibly natural (as if it were lit by the sun, not a spot light). The lighting also gives the animation a more cartoon-y feel. This was done on purpose to coincide the lighthearted nature of the story. For the same reason, I decide to make the main character be a robot instead of a human. Not only are robots easier to model, but the viewer's eye is more forgiving and empathetic toward a simple, not-so-realistic robot than a human model stuck in the uncanny valley.</p>
				<p>My main goal of the story was to have fun and try to make something accessible and funny at the same time. Because this is animation class, I wanted most of the humor to be physical and somewhat surprising.</p>
